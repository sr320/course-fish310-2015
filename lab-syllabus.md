**Lab reports:** You will write a lab report for the Ocean Acidification lab. The draft lab report (Introduction and Methods) is due on April 21/22. You will go through a peer review process (reviews due April 28/29). The reviews should include constructive comments on improving the report and a “grade” (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, or Excellent). The final lab report is due on May 12/13. All reports are due by midnight on the due date and must be turned in via the class website.

**Worksheets:** In each lab period you will fill out a worksheet. This worksheet must be completed by the end of lab and will be checked by TAs.
