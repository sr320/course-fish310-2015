# Heat Stress Lab

The function of this lab is to explore the nature of heat stress in intertidal invertebrates. As climate change rapidly warms coastal waters and changes weather patterns to produce warmer than normal seasonal temperatures, the likelihood of intertidal invertebrates being exposed to lethal heat stress is high. Some species have developed special adaptations to help negate heat stress. These adaptations can vary due to homesite environments which ranges from hospitable to hostile. This quarter we will be investigating varying patterns of heat stress resilience in three populations of Olympia oysters from Puget Sound. These populations have been identified as having different survival rates in varying environments. To verify heat stress resilience as the preliminary reason for these rate differences, we will be performing a heat stress experiment. 


Lab A (4/8-4/9)

- Choose your workgroup (3-4 people)
- Plan your experiment (Don't forget the Control group)
- Decide what equipment you will need.
- Plan how you will measure experiment.
- Background; Design Experiment.
