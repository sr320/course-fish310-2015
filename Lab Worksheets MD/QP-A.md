ATEOL: You will know a lot about our native oyster and have a plan to make new discoveries throughout the quarter. 

# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we will be tackling a larger research question that in built on prior observation that populations Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound are phenotypically  different. As a class we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses and possibly analyzing dataset in new ways.  In today's lab (aka Quarter Project - Lab A) we will be     

* Providing you with some basic information about Olympia oysters    
	* Basic Biology	     
	* Restoration Efforts	     
* Describing recent research findings based on active common garden experiment    
* Plan what we will do as part of this course to learn more about the Olympia oyster.    
	* Decide on experiment and analyses    
	* Develop timeline
