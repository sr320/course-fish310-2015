#Alki Beach: Invertebrate Species Identification

We will be observing and identifying the diverse fauna of the Alki Beach intertidal zone.  Please use care when observing and touching the invertebrates that you find.  Avoid lifting up rocks since you may crush animals when you put them back down.  Make sure you take the time to look in crevices and other hard-to-see places because you may find the coolest inverts there!

####Identify (to the species level) 3 representatives from each of the following phyla:
- Mollusca
- Gastropoda
- Echinodermata
- Cnidaria
####Sketch 1 of these representatives for each phylum.
