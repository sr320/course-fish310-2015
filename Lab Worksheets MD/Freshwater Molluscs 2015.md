### Ideas for lab practical


- Cnidarians:
	- Identify and sort
		- **Hydrozoa**, **Anthozoa**, and **Scyphozoa**
	- two different body plans
		- polyp and medusa
			- differences between them
	- sea pens are some the few cnidarians with bilateral symmetry
	- Hydrozoa
		- what does polymorphism refer to (differnet types of zoooids)
	- Anthozoa
		- no medusa stage
		- draw / exaplin acrorhagi / acontia
		- Where do you expect to find cnidea
	- scyphozoa - true jellyfish
		- ocelli and statocysts
	- box jellies - not featured in lab why?
- Molluscs
	- intro lab was jake
- Bivalves
	- draw a mussel (shell) and label the placement of the adductor muscles
	- draw paths of food / water along the ctendia
	- label the umbo
	- byssal threads are used for..
	- three layers of mussel shell
	- Label the simplified filibranch diagram below with the following features:
		- holobranch
		- outer demibranch
		- foot / visceral mass
	- discuss shells present in lab
- Gastropods
	- location of operculum in helix gastropods  
	- probosis - what is it used for
	- what were the helix using to eat the flour (radula)
- Cephalopods
	- how many hearts, why unique among molluscs
	- what is the cuttlebone used for
	- differences between chamber and paper nautilus shells, what is common about them (pelagic)?
	- dissected squid question?
	- name 2 - cephalopod tissues (any species) that we might find in the fossil record
- Resilience project
	- testing population differences - what 
	- draw a graph of data
	- describe the treatment your lab group decided on - duration - stres, etc. 
	-
