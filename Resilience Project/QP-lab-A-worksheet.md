Equipment needed: your brain

After today you will know a lot about our native Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) and have a plan to make new discoveries relating to the resilience of _Ostrea lurida_ throughout the quarter. 

**Agenda**

- Opening Comments
- Group based questions, discussion (count off)
- Whole class sharing
- Identify project questions and hypotheses (group)
- Develop experiment design (or data analysis approach) (class)
- Short Presentation - stress, genes, etc.
- Plan out next 5 QP labs  (class)

# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?
### Quarter Project - Lab A

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we will be tackling a larger research question; populations of the Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound are phenotypically  distinct. As a class we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses and possibly analyzing dataset in new ways.  In today's lab (Quarter Project - Lab A) we will:     

* Provide you with some basic information about Olympia oysters    
	* Basic Biology	     
	* Restoration Efforts	     
* Describe recent research findings based on an ongoing common garden experiment.    
* Discuss interesting research questions
* Plan experiment(s) and analyses    
* Develop timeline for the quater

## The Olympia Oyster - Basics

- Olympia oysters are the only native oyster to the Pacific coast of the United States.
- Native tribes consumed them on a regular basis as evidenced by archaeological sites.
- In the late 1800's and early 1900's European settlers began harvest Olympia oysters for consumption.
- Olympia oysters were continuously overharvested, leading to collapse within Puget Sound.
- Remnant populations of Olympia oysters still exist today but are small and isolated. 
- Olympia oysters live in the intertidal zone along rocky shorelines.
- Temperatures above 40 C (104 F) or below 0 C (32 F) are associated with significant mortality.
- As well as temperature, they are sensitive to salinity, toxins, and other environmental stressors.

## Common Garden Experiments
In 2014 juvenile oysters produced from broodstock from Fidalgo Bay (North), Dabob Bay (Central), and Oyster Bay (South) were outplanted at each of the above locations plus Clam Bay (Manchester). See map for site locations.

A common garden (or reciprocal transplant) experiment is designed to determine if populations are locally adapted; do populations have higher fitness in home environments than in foreign ones? Transplant experiments are a way to determine if there is a genetic component to phenotypic differences between populations. 

Genetic differences between populations can be the result of natural selection.  Within populations, natural selection can cause evolution as beneficial phenotypes result in higher fitness (more surviving offspring) causing the genetic variants underlying these phenotypes to increase in frequency.  If the environement differs across populations, different phenotypes and genetic variants will be selected eacb, leading to local adapation. 

During the transplant experiment, several outcomes were measured including mortality, growth, and reproductive activity. 
The results were very suprising (and exciting!); like most scientific endevours we left with just as many questions as answers! This quarter we will follow up on the preliminary results by exploring and answering these futher questions.

## So What? 
Small group discussion.    

1) What are 3 main points that you take away from these data?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

2) Given what you list above, what are the ecological and environmental implications?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

3) Given what you listed for question 1, please list all of the factors that likely contribute to the phenotypic differences among populations?
&nbsp;

##Readings
 - Each person from each group will choose 1 of the 4 papers to read so that the group has read all 4 papers.
 - Post a short summary of the paper on the discussion board (no more than 1 paragraph)
 - We will discuss these papers during the next Quarter Project Lab.
 - If you have any questions or concerns, ask them on the discussion board!
