Equipment needed: none

ATEOL: You will know a lot about our native oyster and have a plan to make new discoveries throughout the quarter. 

# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?
### Quarter Project - Lab A

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we will be tackling a larger research question that in built on prior observation that populations Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound are phenotypically  different. As a class we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses and possibly analyzing dataset in new ways.  In today's lab (aka Quarter Project - Lab A) we will be     

* Providing you with some basic information about Olympia oysters    
	* Basic Biology	     
	* Restoration Efforts	     
* Describing recent research findings based on active common garden experiment    
* Plan what we will do as part of this course to learn more about the Olympia oyster.    
	* Decide on experiment and analyses    
	* Develop timeline     

## The Olympia Oyster - Basics











## Results from Common Garden Experiment
In 2014 juvenile oysters produced from broodstock from Fidalgo Bay (North), Dabob Bay (Central), and Oyster Bay (South) were outplanted in a "common garden experiment" at each of the above location plus at Clam Bay - (Manchester). See map for site locations.

This experiment was carried out to determine if any stock was better adapted to live at its home location. One hypothesis is that through natural selection on beneficial phenotypes (recall Lecture 2), the population (and ultimately the ecosystem) will change. Several parameters were measured include mortality, growth, reproductive activity. 
The results were very suprising (and exciting) and like most scientific endevours left us with just as many questions as it did answers! This quarter we will be trying to tackle some of these questions.

##Don't forget the reading online. Choose 2 papers and write a short review of each on the discussion board (No more than 1 paragraph per paper). We will discuss these papers during the next Quarter Project Lab. If you have any questions or concerns, ask them on the discussion board!
