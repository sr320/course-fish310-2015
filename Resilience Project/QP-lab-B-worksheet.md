# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?
### Quarter Project - Lab B

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we are tackling a larger research question: are populations of the Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound phenotypically  distinct? As a class, we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses related to the phenotypic difference between populations.  In today's lab (Quarter Project - Lab B) we will: 

- Finalize the experiment the class will run
- Generate a list of necessary equipment
- Decide what your group will measure
- Prep for your experiment


##Readings

~ Paper discussion~

- What were three main points of the paper you read?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- How did the author come to these conclusions? 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- How would you create an experiment based on this paper?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

~Team paper discussion~

- What is the common theme of the readings?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- How do these readings relate to each other?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- What did you learn that will help during experimental design?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- How will you integrate the reading into the experiment?
&nbsp;

##Class Experiment
~Class Discussion~

- What is the treatment? What is the control?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- What are your treatment levels? Why?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- What equipment is necessary? 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##Group Measurements
~Team Discussion~

- What is your hypothesis? What are the predictions of this hypothesis?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- How will you test your hypothesis, what will you measure?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- What will we learn about differences between populations of _Ostrea lurida_?
