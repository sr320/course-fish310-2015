# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?
### Quarter Project - Lab B

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we are tackling a larger research question: are populations of the Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound phenotypically  distinct? As a class, we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses related to the phenotypic difference between populations.  In today's lab (Quarter Project - Lab B) we will: 

- Finalize the experiment the class will run
- Generate a list of necessary equipment
- Decide what your group will measure
- Prep for your experiment


##Readings

~ Paper discussion~

- What were three main points of the paper you read?

- How did the author come to these conclusions? 

- How would you create an experiment based on this paper?

~Team paper discussion~

- What is the common theme of the readings?

- How do these readings relate to each other?

- What did you learn that will help during experimental design?

- How will you integrate the reading into the experiment?

##Class Experiment
~Class Discussion~
- What is the treatment? What is the control?

- How long is your treatment time?  Why?

- What are your treatment levels? Why?

- What equipment is necessary? 

##Group Measurements
~Team Discussion~

- What is your hypothesis? What are the predictions of this hypothesis?

- How will you test your hypothesis, what will you measure?

- What will we learn about differences between populations of _Ostrea lurida_?

- What equipment will you need?
