# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?
### Quarter Project - Lab B

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we will be tackling a larger research question; populations of the Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound are phenotypically  distinct. As a class we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses and possibly analyzing dataset in new ways.  In today's lab (Quarter Project - Lab B) we will: 


- Finalize the experiment the class will run
- Generate a list of equipment needed for the experiment
- Discuss the types of things your group can measure
- Decide what your group will measure
- Prep for your experiment



##Readings

~First paper discussion~

- What were three main points for the paper you read?

- How did the author come to these conclusions? 

- What might you do to create an experiment based on this paper?

~Team paper discussion~

- What is the common theme of the readings?

- How might these readings relate to each other?

- What does this mean for your experiment?

- How can you integrate the reading into the experiment?


##Class Experiment
~Class Discussion~

- What equipment do you need for your experiment? 

- How long is your treatment time?

- What are your treatment levels?

##Group Measurements
~Team Discussion~

- What is your group's hypothesis about this experiment

- What will your group measure?

- What will this measurement tell you about the animals reaction to stress?

- What equipment will you need to make these measurements?
