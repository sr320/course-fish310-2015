# How different are the native oysters across Puget Sound?
### Quarter Project - Lab B

Throughout this quarter (~5 lab periods) we will be tackling a larger research question; populations of the Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) across Puget Sound are phenotypically  distinct. As a class we will be developing experiments to test new hypotheses and possibly analyzing dataset in new ways.  In today's lab (Quarter Project - Lab B) we will: 

Discuss the types of things your group can measure
Finalize the experiment the class will run
Generate a list of equipment needed for the experiment



##Readings

~First paper discussion~

- What were three main points for the paper you read?

- How did the author come to these conclusions? 

- What might you do to create an experiment based on this paper?

~Team paper discussion~

- What is the common theme of the readings?

- How might these readings relate to each other?

- What does this mean for your experiment?

- How can you integrate the reading into the experiment?
