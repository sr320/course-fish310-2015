#Quarter Project Mon-Wed Thermal Shock Project
##Baseline
Animals kept at 8&deg;C for 3 weeks prior to experiment fed on a daily basis. 
##Experiment
15 Dabob and 15 Oyster bay oysters in a closed treatment aquarium system. 

The temperature will gradually be raised from 8 to 35&deg;C over one hour. 

The animals will then be held at 35&deg;C for 1 hour. 

Then the tanks will be allowed to gradually lower temperature until they reach 8&deg;C.
 
##Sample collection
After 3 hour treatment 5 oysters from each group will be sampled and placed into RNAlater for RNA isolation.
