#Differences in Olympia Oyster Populations at the Gene Expression Level

As part of your experiments you are comparing how different populations will respond to stress to confirm your hypotheses that were generated as part of "Lab A".  This graph should ring a bell.

Today what you will be doing is learning how to measure differences in gene expression. This is a _very valuable_ core technique in biology and works on the general principles of the Polymerase Chain Reaction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technology used to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a piece of DNA  generating thousands to millions of copies of a sequence.

In our case we will be using PCR a fancier version of what is shown above in the sense that we are interested in quantifying the level of gene (mRNA) expression (so we have to make cDNA first) and a flourescent dye is added to the reaction so we can measure easily.

Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction




##qPCR protocol

You will be setting up your own PCR reactions with cDNA that was made from RNA isolated from the tissue samples you took last week. The recipe is below, with `Ssofast Evagreen MM` being a premix that contains nucleotides, buffer, DNA polymerase. The primers are specific to the gene you will be measuring (see PCR figure above). H20 is used to make the volume appropriate (think concentration). Below is the recipe for one reaction and for 8.

|                     | Volume (ul) | Reactions (ul) X8 |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Ssofast Evagreen MM | 10          | 80                |
| FWD Primer          | 0.5         | 4                 |
| REV Primer          | 0.5         | 4                 |
| Nuclease Free H2O   | 8           | 64                |



1. Add each volume (REACTIONS (ul) X8) of reagents in order from greatest to smallest REACTION in 1.5 ml tube (Master Mix)
2. Pipette 19 ul of master mix to each of the 7 tube wells
3. Pipette 1 ul of water into 1 tube
3. Pipette 1 ul of Control into 1 tube
4. Pipette 1 ul of each sample into each of 5 tubes
5. Added clear strip caps to tubes (DO NOT WRITE ON STRIP CAPS)
6. On a separate sheet of paper write down the order of your samples in the wells
