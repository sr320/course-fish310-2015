##qPCR protocol

|                     | Volume (ul) | Reactions (ul) X8 |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Ssofast Evagreen MM | 10          | 80                |
| FWD Primer          | 0.5         | 4                 |
| REV Primer          | 0.5         | 4                 |
| Nuclease Free H2O   | 8           | 64                |



1. Add each volume (REACTIONS (ul) X8) of reagents in order from greatest to smallest REACTION in 1.5 ml tube (Master Mix)
2. Pipette 19 ul of master mix to each of the 7 tube wells
3. Pipette 1 ul of water into 1 tube
3. Pipette 1 ul of Control into 1 tube
4. Pipette 1 ul of each sample into each of 5 tubes
5. Added clear strip caps to tubes (DO NOT WRITE ON STRIP CAPS)
6. On a separate sheet of paper write down the order of your samples in the wells
