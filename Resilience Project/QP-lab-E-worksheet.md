#Data Analysis, Interpretation, and Presentation

The primary goal of this lab is to help you analyze and interpret your data so that you can present your findings to your fellow students. Data analysis is a crucial part of all scientific studies. Today you will learn about interpreting graphs, statistical analysis of data sets, and how to present your information to others in a meaningful way. 

##Data Analysis and Interpretation

####What type of graph did you create with your data?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####What does this graph tell you about your results?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####What type of statistical analysis you have or will use to interpret your data?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####What were your findings from this analysis?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

####Do these findings support or refute your hypothesis?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##Presentation
To show your results to your classmates your group will prepare a 5-10 minute powerpoint presentation discussing your results. You need an introduction including life history information about Ostrea lurida, their importance to the Puget Sound, and why/how you are investigating possible differences between populations. You need a materials and methods with an explanation of the techniques you used to test your animals and all of the equipment you used. Finally you need a results and discussion section to talk about your findings and what they mean for Ostrea lurida populations in the Puget Sound. 

####Create an Outline for your research presentation.
Include number of slides for each part of your presentation, what each slide will cover, and who will present each portion of your presentation. Each member of your group must present at least two slides by themselves.
